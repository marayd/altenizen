                                           FOR ALTENIZEN
                                Copyright (c) mryd / marayddev

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is a legal contract between any individual or entity ("You" or "Licensee") and the author and owner of the Altenizen project, mryd (also known as "marayd" or "marayddev") ("Licensor"). By accessing, downloading, viewing, or otherwise using any part of the Altenizen software project, including but not limited to binary distributions and source code, You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

The Altenizen project is proprietary software. While parts of it may be publicly visible (e.g., via GitHub or Jenkins), such visibility does not imply or confer any open-source license. This Agreement divides the use and access permissions into two distinct domains:

1. **Jenkins Build Artifacts**
2. **GitHub Source Code Repository**
